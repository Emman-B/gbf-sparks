# GBF Spark Calculator

This is a simple tool for calculating a "Spark" in Granblue Fantasy.

The entire tool is fully functioning on the front-end. Any data you input is processed directly in-app and not by some other external tool.

## Usage
The tool can be accessed at: https://Emman-B.github.io/gbf-sparks/ .

To calculate a spark, input how many crystals, ten-draw tickets, and single-draw tickets you have into the corresponding input boxes. Then, press the calculate button and it will display all of the calculation results.

## Miscellaneous
All of the HTML, CSS, and JS that was written was done from scratch with no framework. This was meant to brush up on some HTML/CSS/JS skills.
